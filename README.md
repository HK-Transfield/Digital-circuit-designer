# Digital-circuit-designer
The main goal of this simple Digital Circuit Design program is to allow engineers to design and test simple digital circuits.
This was created for an assignment.

## Overview
This program allows the user to create various kinds of logic gates (AND/OR/NOT etc.), input sources and output 
lamps.You can move them around the design windowm add wires to connect them together, and so on. Each logic gate
and wire is represented in the program by an object with methods like Draw, and properties like Left and Top.
